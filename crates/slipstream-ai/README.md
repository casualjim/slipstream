# Slipstream AI

Slipstream AI is a Rust library for building and orchestrating AI agents with a focus
on reliability, extensibility, and maintainable workflows.

## Overview

Slipstream AI provides a robust foundation for creating AI-powered applications by offering:

- **Agent Orchestration**: Coordinate multiple AI agents working together
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Built on a reliable event system for agent communication
- **Provider Abstraction**: Flexible integration with AI providers
- **Tool System**: Extensible framework for adding custom capabilities to agents
- **Memory Management**: Built-in short-term memory system for context retention

### Core Components

- **Agent**: Manages AI agent lifecycle and coordination
- **Provider**: Abstracts AI provider integration (e.g., OpenAI)
- **Tool**: Extensible system for adding capabilities to agents
- **Events**: Reliable event system for agent communication
- **Memory**: Short-term memory management for context retention
